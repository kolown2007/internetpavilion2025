A whole, before it scattered.


Every time we move through places and spaces
I wonder — 
is light as relevant as time?
Does the way you view a place, a thing, or a person 
shift as time drifts?

Parallax, a movement not just in optics or geometry,
lives in how one’s view of the cosmos, of people, of things, shifts
as you experience and explore through the slow drift of time.

A reality. 
A memory.
Parallax is as emotional 
as it is perceptual.

Light, a metaphor,
a question I keep coming back to
to sense, to feel,
a quiet witness to what I cannot say.

Natural or artificial, it distorts, reveals, disappears,
or lingers at the periphery.

Trace, a history of being.
We return to it
in echoes of nostalgia,
in shifting ways of seeing,
in moments already fading.

In light, we sense the trace.
